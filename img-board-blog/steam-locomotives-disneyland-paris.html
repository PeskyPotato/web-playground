                <p>I recently visited Disneyland Paris and I spent more time researching and experiencing the Paris metro system and the RER than looking up and preparing for Disneyland itself. Upon visiting the park in Disneyland Paris I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted by a railway line right by the park entrance. There was no crowd, no line whatsoever, just an elegantly designed station. Going up the stairs I saw the steam locomotive coupled to passenger cars about to depart. I just stumbled across a train!</p>

                <p>After waiting a few minutes the staff ushered us to the platform where we saw a second locomotive approach. Doors were opened, passengers disembarked and we hopped on. Could this give us a good view of the park? Is this a reliable form of transport to different locations? How has no one talked about this before?</p>
